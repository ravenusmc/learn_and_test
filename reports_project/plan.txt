Plan for project: 
I will have two main phases. 

1. To filter the spreadsheet by office and then to sort by a specific date. This will build
a spreadsheet for each office. 

2. The second major part will be to add the notes from the prio months reports into the 
reports. 


That’s *very* possible — and honestly, quite a practical and clean little automation project.

Here’s a quick rundown of how you could structure it:

1. **Read the Excel file** — using `pandas.read_excel()` with `sheet_name=None` to load all three worksheets into a dictionary of DataFrames.
-DONE THIS PART 

2. **Export each worksheet to CSV** — loop through that dictionary and use `df.to_csv()` for each sheet.
-DONE 

3. **Filter each CSV by office location** — read each back in (or use the DataFrames directly) and apply filters, e.g.

   ```python
   df_clp = df[df["Office"] == "CLP"]
   df_appoints = df[df["Office"] == "APPOINTS"]
   df_wgi = df[df["Office"] == "WGI"]
   ```

4. **Write those filtered DataFrames back into a new Excel file** — use `pandas.ExcelWriter()` to create one file with each office’s data as a worksheet.

   ```python
   with pd.ExcelWriter("Filtered_Report.xlsx") as writer:
       df_clp.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="CLP", index=False)
       df_appoints.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Appoints", index=False)
       df_wgi.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="WGI", index=False)
   ```

So yes — **totally doable in 40–60 lines of Python** using only the `pandas` library.

If you’d like, I can sketch a skeleton version (no full logic, just the structure) so you can see how the flow would look — want me to do that?
